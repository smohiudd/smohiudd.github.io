This is a simple sketch of 3D arcs using [bezier curves](https://javascript.info/bezier-curve). They can be a little tricky to figure out, especially when you can't see the handles. I've been using them for a while in photoshop and have a pretty good grasp on how to manipulate them. I might try implementing this in a mapping visualization. Here is the [code](https://github.com/smohiudd/Drawing-3D-Arcs).
