### Sometimes you want to just admire the craziness of public transit. [Transitflow](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-processing-animation) is a tool that visualizes the flow of transit systems using static GTFS. I tried it out on a bunch of Canadian cities.

**Transitflow** was developed by [Will Geary](https://willgeary.github.io/) and uses the [Transitland](https://transit.land/) feed registry and API along with [Processing](https://processing.org/) to visualize the transit trips on a given day.

I ran the tool on a number of Canadian cities. Each of the visualizations below is for a typical Monday service schedule.
